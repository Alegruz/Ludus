# Ludus

Ludus is a C++23 engine and toolset in active development, with modular runtime
systems, an installed SDK and CLI, and an optional Linux editor. A bounded editor
preview also runs in the browser.

[Read Ludus Wiki](https://alegruz.github.io/Ludus/) or open
[the same documentation locally](docs/README.md). The Markdown, local assets and
checked HTML are also available as an [offline bundle](docs/development/wiki.md#offline-reading).

## Build the engine

The native reference host is Ubuntu 24.04 with Clang/LLVM 18. From a clone:

```bash
./init.sh --cli linux-clang-development --preset-only --locked --with-tests
./scripts/build linux-clang-development
./scripts/test linux-clang-development
```

[Building Ludus](docs/development/building.md) owns setup flags, Linux/headless
and container instructions, macOS support, presets, IDE setup and validation.
Initial dependency setup needs internet; prepared builds use the local cache.
