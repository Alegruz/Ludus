"""Verify every installed/public engine header compiles standalone.

Header self-sufficiency contract (docs/architecture/foundational-headers.md
Section 14, ADR 0007): a public header must compile on its own, i.e. it must
include everything it uses and MUST NOT rely on the consumer having included
something else first. The one sanctioned universally-available header is
<ludus/foundation/base/core.h>; a public header that uses the foundational
vocabulary includes core.h (or the specific Band 0 header) itself rather than
assuming it arrived transitively.

This is a mechanical gate, not prose: for each public header under
modules/**/include/ludus/** (and tools/**/include) it compiles a tiny
translation unit that includes ONLY that header (with -fsyntax-only).

The compile flags are reconstructed from compile_commands.json so the check
sees exactly what the build sees (the C++ standard, warnings-as-errors, the
generated-header include dirs, etc.). Because each module target carries only
its own include directories, a single translation unit's flags cannot resolve
headers from other modules; this script therefore takes a representative TU's
non-path flags and unions in the include directories (-I / -isystem / -iquote /
-idirafter and their generated-header variants) from EVERY entry in the compile
database, so any public header resolves regardless of which module owns it.

Usage: verify_header_self_sufficiency.py <build_dir>
