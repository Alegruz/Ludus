# When LUDUS_ENABLE_PCH is ON, CMake injects precompiled-header flags into every
# compile command. Replaying such a command for a policy/self-sufficiency probe
# must NOT touch the PCH: it would force-include the precompiled foundational
# header (defining assert_config.hpp macros -> breaks the override-rejection
# probe) or feed the binary .pch back as a source (CPCH parse errors / UTF-8
# decode failures). A PCH is a build accelerator only (ADR 0007), so these probes
# strip every PCH-related flag and observe identical results with or without it.
#

#   -include <cmake_pch.hxx>                     (force-include the PCH header)
#   -include-pch <path.pch|.gch>                 (consume a PCH directly)
#   -Xclang -emit-pch                            (generate a PCH; the PCH entry)
#   -Xclang -include-pch -Xclang <path.pch>      (consume via cc1)
#   -Xclang <path.pch|.hxx>                      (cc1 PCH path argument)
