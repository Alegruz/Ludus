// WorkspaceState and the pure transition function.

// Private editor header (not installed). WorkspaceState is the single owner of
// saved/draft settings, descriptor path/digest, project epoch, operation phase,
// last result, discovered targets and the active job. The transition function
// is tested independently of any widget or tool (design.md sections 3, 6).
//
// It uses private Qt value types but creates no widgets and runs no tools.
