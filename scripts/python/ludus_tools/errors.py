"""Stable error vocabulary shared by the CLI and Editor backend.

Every recoverable failure in the host tooling is reported with a stable string
``code`` plus a human ``message``. The codes match the Editor E0 ``ResultCode``
vocabulary (``apps/editor/src/internal/project_descriptor.h``) so the CLI and the
Editor streaming protocol describe the same failures identically (P07). A
``ToolingError`` never crosses into C++: it is caught at the protocol/CLI
boundary and translated to a structured result.
