"""Bundle the redistributable dependency closure into an SDK prefix (P02).

A relocatable SDK must link from a fresh extraction with no producer Conan cache
on the search path. The engine's exported ``LudusConfig.cmake`` therefore calls
``find_dependency(volk/freetype/harfbuzz)`` against a **package-local** search
root, ``<prefix>/lib/cmake/Ludus/dependencies``. This module populates that root
at install time by copying, out of the Conan install:

* the generator-produced CMake package files (``*-config.cmake``,
  ``*Targets*.cmake``, ``*-data.cmake``, ``cmakedeps_macros.cmake`` …) that make
  ``find_package(<dep>)`` work — these live in the Conan *generators output
  folder*, NOT inside the package directories; and
* each dependency's package payload (``lib/`` static libs, ``include/`` headers,
  any ``lib/cmake`` build modules), copied under ``dependencies/packages/<dep>``.

Every absolute producer path (the Conan cache package roots and the generators
folder) is then rewritten to a path relative to the bundled location so the
bundle relocates. The rewrite is the error-prone part and is unit-tested; the
copy orchestration runs during ``install-sdk`` on a machine with Conan.

Nothing here depends on Qt or the engine; it uses only the standard library.
