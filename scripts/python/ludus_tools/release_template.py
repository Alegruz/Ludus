Build a native package with `ludus project package . --profile linux-release --version 0.1.0`.
Select a Release SDK explicitly if your local SDK is another flavor. Packaging
builds before installing and validates a clean extraction; it never uploads.

Verify the printed directory with `ludus project package verify <directory>`.
Run release tests against extracted game.zip before distributing it. Read the
manifest for external system libraries and SDK/platform requirements. NOTICE.txt
and SDK notices are a starting point; add licenses for authored assets/dependencies.

If itch.io is configured, use `ludus project publish plan . --package <directory>
--destination linux` to inspect the offline plan. Packages from local overrides
or dirty/unknown sources require `--allow-local-inputs`. This command does not
upload, authenticate, install butler or generate CI. See the installed tooling
guides for explicit setup, Editor controls and supported upload hosts. A channel name does
not change itch.io project visibility. Account credentials never belong in Git.

macOS: use a matching thin arm64 or x86_64 Release SDK and Clang 18/libc++.
The generated install component creates an app bundle. Declare assets and

binaries are outside this initial policy. Libraries require their own relative
search paths; inherited dyld run-path stacks are not emulated.
Packaging signs nested images, then the app, locally with an ad-hoc identity.
It verifies signatures again after clean extraction. This is not Developer ID
signing, notarization or Gatekeeper qualification; those require a separate
explicit distribution workflow. No keychain identity or account is used.
