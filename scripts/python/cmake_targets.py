"""Shared CMake File API codemodel query/read helpers.

This module holds the ONLY copy of the File API named-query creation and
codemodel/target/artifact resolution logic. It was extracted from rad_debugger.py
so both the RAD debugger integration and the editor workspace adapter resolve a
CMake executable target through one tested implementation, parameterized by the
File API named-client directory.

RAD delegates here with its historical client name ("ludus-debug"); the editor
uses "ludus-editor". The editor path additionally enforces the bounded-reply
limits and executable-only listing described in
.kiro/specs/editor-workspace/design.md section 7. RAD keeps its own argument
restrictions, sessions and launch behavior; only the File API logic is shared.

No exceptions cross into engine C++: this is Python tooling. The caller supplies
an `engine`-like module exposing EngineError and read_json; failures are raised
as EngineError with actionable messages.
