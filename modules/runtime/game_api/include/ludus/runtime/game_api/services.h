// Host service table (design section 6).
//
// The gameplay module calls a passed engine service table, never host-exported
// C++ symbols. Services cover explicit diagnostics, bounded allocation,
// frame/input data, resource IDs and the sample's render parameters. The table
// is grown with concrete consumer requirements, not by forwarding every engine
// API speculatively. All callbacks are noexcept POD function pointers.
//
// Service handles carry the session and resource generation; the host revokes a
// stale table after reload so a cached pointer cannot outlive its generation.
// Host allocations are released only through matching host services; a module
// never cross-module delete()s host memory (design 6).
