// Fixed-capacity single-producer / single-consumer ring for audio command
// batches and debug snapshots, per .kiro/specs/audio/design.md section 4 and 11.
//
// Contract:
//  - One producer thread, one consumer thread. No MPSC, no CAS retry loop, no
//    spinning in rendering, no hidden lock fallback.
//  - Payload bytes are written before the producer publishes with a release
//    store; the consumer acquires publication before reading. A slot cannot be
//    overwritten until the producer observes the consumer's release.
//  - Counters are uint32 and verified lock-free; capacity is kept below half the
//    counter space so unsigned distance arithmetic is unambiguous. Counter wrap
//    is safe for queue arithmetic only (never for identity generations).
//
// This container owns no heap: storage is an embedded fixed array. Enqueue is
// batch-aware: the producer reserves space for a whole batch and publishes it
// with a single release update after writing every record (never splitting a
// batch across the publication boundary).
