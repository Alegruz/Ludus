// Caller-owned PCG32 (XSH-RR) random stream (design §11).
//
// This is an opt-in, explicitly-seeded, non-cryptographic simulation PRNG. There
// is no global generator, no time-based or automatic reseeding, no thread-local
// stream and no cryptographic promise. Gameplay assigns stable stream selectors.
//
// Provenance: the PCG algorithm and the seeding sequence are adapted from Melissa
// O'Neill's PCG reference "pcg-c-basic" (pcg_basic.c; https://www.pcg-random.org/),
// which is distributed under the Apache License 2.0. Only the small integer
// algorithm (XSH-RR output, LCG step, two-step seeding) is reimplemented here in
// Ludus style; no source file is copied. See modules/foundation/math/README.md
// for the attribution and the frozen known-answer sequence.
//
// The integer sequence and saved state have a BIT-EXACT contract for the same
// logical stream, seed and call order. The [0,1) float mapping is also fixed and
// versioned. Replay can still differ if a different number of rejection draws is
// consumed (e.g. a different bound) — ownership of the logical call order is the
// caller's.
