# ADR 0010: FoundationMath Module Conventions and Contracts

## Status

Proposed (implementation in progress). Supersedes nothing; extends the
foundational-module layering of ADR 0007 and the standard-library policy of
ADR 0003 (see the narrow `<cmath>`/`<limits>` allowance recorded there).

## Context

Ludus needs a small, allocation-free math vocabulary for 2D gameplay/UI, 3D
camera and transform work, primitive spatial queries, and repeatable gameplay
random streams. The requirements, architecture and staged plan are in
`.kiro/specs/math/{requirements,design,tasks}.md`; the self-contained source
research is `docs/architecture/math-research.md`. This ADR freezes the
decisions those documents selected so there is a single authoritative record of
the conventions, status/output contracts and the v1 public API inventory. It is
an engineering judgement for this checkout, not a claim of superiority over GLM,
DirectXMath, RTM or any custom library; none of those has been benchmarked
against this module.

## Decision

### Module shape and dependencies

- A new static library `ludus_foundation_math`, exported as
  `Ludus::FoundationMath`, living at `modules/foundation/math/`.
- It depends only on `Ludus::FoundationBase`. It requires no logger, profiler,
  allocator, containers, Platform, graphics API, jobs, initialization step or
  mutable global service. There is no `MathSystem`, registry or hidden cache.
- Only public headers are installed. Math is **not** added to Base's `core.h`,
  `config.h`, `compiler.h`, `types.h` or the shared foundational PCH; it is an
  opt-in layer that consumers include explicitly.
- Public headers are self-sufficient and lightweight: each includes exactly the
  Base and sibling math headers it names, plus `<span>` where a span API needs
  it. No heavy STL header, no private `internal/` header and no third-party math
  type appears in any installed signature.

### Mathematical conventions (frozen)

| Concern | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| World/local 3D | Right-handed; +X right, +Y up; camera looks toward -Z |
| Cross product | `Cross(+X,+Y) = +Z`; positive rotation follows the right hand |
| Angles / distances | Radians; meter examples. Degrees via named conversion |
| Vector action | Column vectors: `pOut = M * pIn` |
| Matrix composition | `A * B` applies B then A; `world = parent * local` |
| Matrix storage | Column-major; element access `M(row, column)` |
| Quaternion | Hamilton product; components `(x, y, z, w)`; unit action `q*(0,v)*conjugate(q)` |
| Quaternion composition | `a * b` rotates by b then a |
| Projection | NDC X/Y in `[-1,1]`, Z in `[0,1]`, Y up (matches WebGPU) |
| Framebuffer | Top-left; X right, Y down; physical pixels |
| Screen 2D | `Vector2`/`Affine2` carry no implicit camera/unit conversion |

Euler-angle storage and ambiguous `Euler` constructors are absent. There is no
global handedness or convention switch. Values are standard-layout, trivially
copyable, zero/identity-initialized as specified, with natural scalar alignment
and no hidden SIMD padding, virtual functions, swizzle proxies or expression
templates.

### Numerical and failure contracts (frozen)

- Checked, fallible operations return `[[nodiscard]] MathStatus` and write
  caller-owned outputs **only on success**: compute a complete local result,
  validate it, then assign. On any failure every output is left byte-for-byte
  unchanged, including when an output aliases an input. Exact single-value
  aliasing is supported by computing into temporaries.
- `MathStatus` is a small enum: `Success`, `NonFiniteInput`, `InvalidArgument`,
  `Degenerate`, `IllConditioned`, `OutOfRange`, `SizeMismatch`. No strings, no
  owning result framework. Multi-failure precedence is not an ABI promise.
- Queries return `MathStatus` plus a structured result that distinguishes a
  normal geometric miss (`Success` + `Miss`) from invalid/numerically
  unsupported input (a failing status, output unchanged). Result records have
  initialized neutral fields; numeric hit fields are meaningful only on `Hit`.
- Every public function is `noexcept`; engine exceptions stay disabled.
- Assertions diagnose programmer preconditions in development builds; they never
  substitute for a runtime check and never perform an unsafe float-to-int cast
  or out-of-bounds access, so a resumable assertion that returns cannot cause
  out-of-range memory access.
- No universal epsilon, no fuzzy `operator==`, and no claim of cross-platform
  bitwise float determinism. Tolerances are named per operation with documented
  units (see `scalar.hpp`, the policy structs and §4 of the design). Initial
  thresholds are Ludus choices calibrated against the M0 corpus and may be
  adjusted with recorded evidence before the API is frozen.
- The CPU contract assumes round-to-nearest IEEE binary32/64 with NaN/Inf and
  signed-zero handling. Math never changes rounding, FTZ/DAZ or FP traps, never
  enables fast math, and rejects translation of its headers under
  `__FAST_MATH__` or a nonzero `__FINITE_MATH_ONLY__` with a useful `#error`.
  Checked `.cpp` algorithms are compiled with `-ffp-contract=off` and no fast
  math; inline operators inherit the consumer's flags, which the module
  documents consumers must keep finite/signed-zero correct.

### v1 public API inventory (frozen for this ADR)

Headers under `include/ludus/foundation/math/`:

- `status.hpp` — `MathStatus`.
- `scalar.hpp` — Pi/Tau, radians/degrees, `Abs/Min/Max/Clamp`, finite checks,
  `Sqrt/Sin/Cos/Atan2`, `Lerp`, `SmoothStep01`, ranged smoothstep,
  `NearlyEqual`, `TryApproachExponential`.
- `vector.hpp` — `Vector2/3/4`, `Vector3d`, arithmetic, `Dot`, `Cross`,
  `Hadamard`, `Length`/`LengthSquared`/`Distance`, `TryNormalize`,
  `TryNormalizeOr`, componentwise `Lerp`.
- `quaternion.hpp` — `Quaternion`, identity, `TryFromAxisAngle`, Hamilton
  `operator*`, `Conjugate`, `Rotate`, `TryRotationBetween`,
  `NlerpShortest`/`SlerpShortest`, `SameRotation`.
- `matrix.hpp` — `Matrix3/4`, `Identity`/`Zero`, action, multiply, `Transpose`,
  `TryInverse` with `InversePolicy`, `Matrix3` from a unit quaternion,
  `TryToRotation`.
- `transform.hpp` — `Affine2/3`, `TransformTRS`, point/vector/normal transforms,
  compose, `TryInverse`, `TryTransformNormal`, TRS→affine conversion,
  `ToMatrix4`, `TryPerspectiveDivide`.
- `projection.hpp` — `TryLookAt`, finite/infinite reverse-Z perspective, finite
  reverse-Z orthographic, NDC↔framebuffer conversion.
- `geometry.hpp` — `Plane`, `Aabb2/3`, `Sphere`, `Ray3`, `RayInterval`,
  `Frustum`, result records.
- `queries.hpp` — plane distance/reflection, AABB transform/merge/contains,
  ray/AABB, ray/sphere, closest segment points, frustum extraction and
  conservative sphere/AABB classification.
- `precision.hpp` — `TryMakeRelative` (double position − double origin → float).
- `random.hpp` — `RandomStream` (PCG32 XSH-RR), `RandomState`.
- `batch.hpp` — `TryTransformPoints`, `TryClassifySpheres`.

The module ships no umbrella header initially. Scope deliberately deferred:
physics, IK, animation curves/squad, quaternion compression, geometric algebra,
exact predicates/CSG, procedural noise, non-uniform distributions, fixed-point
lockstep, public SIMD register types, full double math, reflection,
serialization frameworks, collision acceleration and scene/editor services.

### Standard-math implementation allowance

The checked `.cpp` algorithms use `<cmath>` and `<limits>` for standard numeric
facilities (`std::sqrt`, `std::sin`, `std::fma` is **not** used on the checked
path, `std::nextafter`, `std::numeric_limits`, etc.). This narrow allowance,
and why it introduces no exceptions, allocation or heavy public-header cost, is
recorded in ADR 0003. Standard libm is used first; no hand-written trig
approximations from historical books. `constexpr` is applied only where the
implementation actually supports it on the pinned compilers.

## Consequences

- Consumers get a readable scalar baseline with explicit conventions and
  numerical failure contracts, and a stable public layout that a future bulk
  SIMD kernel can optimize behind without changing the API.
- CPU results are numerically equivalent within documented bounds, not bit-exact
  across libm/Wasm/GPU/compiler versions. The PCG integer sequence and saved
  state have a separate bit-exact contract.
- Because the module owns no world origin, depth state or shader payload type,
  large-coordinate rebasing, depth clear/compare selection and GPU buffer layout
  remain the consuming renderer/simulation's responsibility.
