# Terrain and generation

Terrain is a proposed Ludus subsystem. Use the canonical engineering documents
below when planning its implementation or reviewing a terrain change. They
contain the contracts, implementation gates and reference attribution; this page
provides a reading path.

| Your task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Choose the terrain representation and integration boundaries | [Terrain systems architecture](../../architecture/terrain.md) |
| Implement coordinates, queries, LOD, materials, editing or residency | [Terrain contracts](../../architecture/terrain.md#coordinates-and-canonical-surface) |
| Design source layers, deterministic recipes, hydrology, erosion or cooking | [Terrain generation](../../architecture/terrain-generation.md) |
| Assess which Gems articles changed the design and which were deferred | [Gems and research review](../../architecture/terrain-gems-review.md) |
| Plan research after the baseline is implemented and validated | [Post-baseline research queue](../../architecture/terrain-gems-review.md#post-baseline-research-queue) |
| Plan delivery and performance acceptance | [Terrain delivery gates](../../architecture/terrain.md#performance-and-delivery-gates) and [generation validation](../../architecture/terrain-generation.md#validation-and-delivery) |

For existing engine integration, continue with [platform and rendering](rendering.md),
[world publication](world.md) and [content ownership](content.md). Check
[current capabilities](../getting-started/status.md) before treating a proposed
adapter or renderer as an available SDK facility.
