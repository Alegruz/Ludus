# Install and launch

Prepare the desktop editor once, then use it to open, build and run projects.
The supported native editor host is **Ubuntu 24.04, Linux x64**. The engine uses
C++23 with Clang/LLVM 18 and LLD; Qt stays outside the engine SDK.

## 1. Get the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alegruz/Ludus.git
cd Ludus
```

Keep this engine checkout separate from game projects you create.
For the rendering tutorial, use a Wayland desktop with a Vulkan-capable driver;
see [Building Ludus](../../development/building.md) for system prerequisites.

## 2. Use graphical initialization

From the checkout root, launch the setup window:

```bash
./init.sh
```

1. Under **Workflow**, select **Application developer**.
2. Keep **Build preset** set to `linux-clang-development` and
   **Prepare only the selected preset** checked.
3. Check **Build Ludus editor (Linux x64; installs optional Qt 6 packages)**.
4. Choose **Initialize**. The selection window closes and preparation continues
   in the terminal; leave that terminal open and follow its progress.

Initialization prepares pinned tools and dependencies, installs missing supported
system prerequisites when needed, and builds the editor. First-time setup can
download dependencies and request a sudo password for system packages. Cancelling
the selection window starts no setup actions. Tests are optional here; engine
contributors have additional validation steps in the building guide.

**Checkpoint:** initialization completes successfully and reports the prepared
editor. If it fails, fix the reported prerequisite before launching. Merely
closing the selection window does not mean setup succeeded.

For terminal-only initialization, the equivalent choice is:

```bash
./init.sh --cli --persona application --with-editor --preset-only
```

If you manage system packages yourself, install the required toolchain and Qt,
then add `--no-system-install` to that command.

## 3. Launch the editor

```bash
./scripts/editor --preset linux-clang-development
```

The launcher opens the already-built editor; it does not build or install it.
**Checkpoint:** Welcome offers **New Project**, **Open Project** and recent
projects. After this initial launch, project setup and normal builds happen in
the editor rather than through a series of setup commands.

## 4. Choose your first walkthrough

- [Your first rendered scene: Cornell box](../../examples/cornell-box.md): open a
  working sample, run it, change materials and geometry, and experiment with light
  and shadows. Includes runtime screenshots and expected results for each edit.
- [Create your first project](first-project.md): generate a minimal native project
  in a new folder and learn the project's build/run/reopen workflow.

## Engine contributors and other hosts

Use [Building Ludus](../../development/building.md) for engine validation,
headless and sandbox requirements, the development container, macOS and profile
selection. The native editor is currently Linux-only; the Cornell box guide has
an independent command-line route for macOS. See
[contributing](../contribute/index.md) for review gates.
