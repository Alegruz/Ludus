## 0. Executive summary of what changed

The baseline was **substantially right** and survives largely intact. The references did
not overturn its structure; they **hardened its semantics** in four places and forced two
outright corrections. Net changes from baseline:

| # | Change | Class | Driver (evidence) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | **Event/timeline stream is the ground truth; the hierarchical tree is a *derived* off-line view.** Baseline already leaned this way; now it is a firm, load-bearing rule. | **[FP+R]** | H's shared-`CurrentNode` tree and R's parent-inference are aggregations that discard chronology and don't survive concurrency (review §4.4, §7.1–7.2). |
| C2 | **Invocation counts (calls/frame) and explicit inclusive-vs-exclusive semantics become first-class**, not optional presentation. | **[R→adopt]** | R & H: counts distinguish *more work* from *slower work* and expose behavioral bugs; ambiguous "time" misleads (review §2.3, §4.3). |
| C3 | **Instrumentation identity is split into three orthogonal axes: site, caller-context, and category** — never one identifier standing for all. | **[R→adopt]** | H (caller context), E (category/group), R/H (site). Review §7.1: "One identifier cannot safely stand for all four." Rejects raw-pointer identity. |
| C4 | **Memory profiling is fully severed from Trace's transport and loss policy.** It gets provenance-at-free, its own lossless/snapshot contract, and lives with the allocator. Corrects baseline §10's "feeds the *same* capture infrastructure." | **[R→adopt]** | L: a lost free permanently corrupts live-byte accounting; frees cross threads and outlive scopes/captures (review §5, §6). |
| C5 | **Corrected the baseline §4 claim that "RAII lexical scope enforces same-thread begin/end."** It does not under coroutine suspension / job migration. Same-thread pairing is now an explicit *contract*, and cross-context work uses flow events, not one spanning scope. | **[R→adopt]** | Review §7.2, §8: "a coroutine can suspend with an RAII object alive and resume elsewhere." |
| C6 | **Statistical outputs must name their window and denominator; smoothed display is separated from exact retained hitch evidence.** Decaying extrema are banned as generic min/max. | **[R→adopt]** | R's decaying extrema "can conceal an earlier hitch"; percentages shift when the denominator changes (review §2.4, §8). |
| C7 | **Clock correctness precedes speed, made explicit as a gate.** Keep `steady_clock` ns; TSC only after a measured ordering/frequency/migration contract. | **[FP+R]** | E's/H's raw-tick + CPU-MHz calibration is not a sufficient modern contract (review §3.4, §4.2). |

Everything else in the baseline — three separate subsystems, cheap-to-include header,
per-thread chunked lock-free buffers, off-path collector reusing the logging `AsyncBackend`
discipline, Perfetto-first export, deferring GPU until an RHI and memory until an allocator
— is **kept**. No historical *mechanism* (global name arrays, FourCC, binary patching,
single-precision seconds, shared current-node, draw-time reset) was adopted.

---

## 1. Goals and non-goals (kept, with two sharpened goals)

Baseline goals stand **[FP]**. Sharpened by the references:

- **[R→adopt]** Add explicit goal: *distinguish workload change (calls/frame) from cost
  change (time/call)*. R and H both show this is often the fastest route from symptom to
  cause and can reveal work that runs twice or never (review §2.1, §4.3).
- **[FP+R]** Reframe the "historical inspection" goal: retain **temporal evidence around
  an unexpected hitch**, because every historical summary model (running totals, reset
  windows, decaying stats) *discards the sequence that produced a peak* (review §4.4). This
  is exactly what the baseline's ring + pre/post-trigger capture (§12) provides, and the
  references make it the decisive advantage of an event model over an aggregate model.

Non-goals unchanged **[FP]**: not a sampling profiler, not an in-engine flame-chart UI,
not a GPU capture tool, not a telemetry platform. The review **reinforces** these: modern
Perfetto/Tracy/perf/heaptrack/RenderDoc cover visualization, sampling, and graphics
capture, narrowing the reason to build engine code to *semantic context tools can't know*
(review §7.5).

## 2. Step 1 — Re-evaluation of every major baseline decision

| # | Baseline decision (profiling.md) | Verdict | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Three independent subsystems (Trace / Counters / GPU+Memory), not one framework (§2) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Review §6 independently reaches the same separation for memory ("different completion rules are stronger evidence for separate ownership"). Strengthened, not weakened. |
| D2 | Cheap-to-include public header; type-erase heavy logic to `.cpp` (§18) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | All four articles omit build-cost analysis (review §2.4, §3.4, §4.4, §5.4); the review repeatedly warns not to put containers/UI/platform deps in a ubiquitous header. Confirms our constraint. |
| D3 | Compile-time-gated RAII scope; disabled = zero code (§3–4) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Universally endorsed (R/E/H all converge on RAII + compile-out). Review §8 asks only to *verify* true compile-out and early-return pairing — a validation gate, not a design change. |
| D4 | Event stream as primary representation; hierarchy derived (§3, §4-hierarchy) | **Refine → make firm rule (C1)** **[FP+R]** | Baseline said "reconstructed off-line"; the review's dissection of H's tree and R's parent-inference proves the tree must *never* be the producer-side ground truth. Elevated to an invariant (§6 here). |
| D5 | Per-thread chunked ring, lock-free chunk handoff, off-path collector (§6, §23) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Review §7.2/§7.3: TLS partitions attribution but "does not establish scalability"; per-thread buffers + bounded preallocation are the right primitives, to be *measured* not assumed. Matches baseline's own [?meas] posture. |
| D6 | Compile-time FNV-1a name hash → `ZoneRegistry`; id in events (§13–14) | **Refine (C3)** **[FP+R]** | Keep hashed *site* identity; **add** a separate caller-context axis and category axis. Review §7.1 + rejection of raw-pointer identity (H/L). Baseline conflated site with context. |
| D7 | Frame = boundary markers + epoch, not a container (§8) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Review §7.2 independently: "not every quantity is frame-owned or frame-resettable"; begin-frame attribution for boundary-crossing scopes is the right call. Add a gate comparing begin-frame vs clip-to-frame (§12). |
| D8 | Counters/gauges as a separate scalar subsystem (§11) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Review §8 explicitly warns *not* to equate scalar counters with timed scopes just because Evertt calls both "counters." Our separation is correct; we make the distinction sharper (§3 here). |
| D9 | Hitch detection = ring + pre/post-trigger capture, evaluated on collector (§12) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | This is the modern extension the historical summary models *lack* (review §4.4, §8). Add a gate: pre-trigger data must survive overload and export must not induce a second hitch. |
| D10 | Visualization external-first (Perfetto), tiny overlay only (§16–17) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Review §7.5 documents that Perfetto track events already provide nested slices/counters/flows; an engine tree viewer is no longer justified. Reinforced. |
| D11 | Statistics as off-line derivation (§1, §11, §16) | **Refine (C6)** **[R→adopt]** | Add hard rule: every statistic names its window + denominator; smoothed UI is separate from exact hitch evidence; no decaying extrema masquerading as min/max. |
| D12 | Clock = `steady_clock` ns now; `rdtscp` later behind an abstraction (§5) | **Keep, elevate to gate (C7)** **[FP+R]** | Review §3.4/§4.2 dismantles raw-tick+MHz calibration. Correctness (ordering, frequency contract, migration) is a *precondition* for any TSC backend, not an optimization detail. |
| D13 | Same-thread scope pairing "enforced by RAII lexical scope" (§4) | **Replace (C5)** **[R→adopt]** | Factually wrong for coroutines/migration (review §7.2). Replace with an explicit contract + flow events for cross-context work. |
| D14 | GPU trace design, build later (§9) | **Keep / Postpone** **[FP+R]** | No RHI exists. Review §4.4 adds: a CPU scope around a graphics call measures CPU elapsed incl. waits, *not* GPU execution — reinforces that GPU needs its own timestamp path. Keep design; still postponed. |
| D15 | Memory profiling deferred, tiered, allocator-owned (§10) | **Refine (C4)** **[R→adopt]** | Keep deferral and tiers; **correct** the "feeds the same capture infrastructure" wording — memory needs provenance-at-free and its own loss/snapshot contract, not Trace's drop policy. |
| D16 | `JobId` field reserved now, correlation logic later (§7) | **Keep** **[FP+R]** | Review §7.2 confirms cross-thread/task correlation "must be modeled separately"; a reserved field + flow events is the right seam. |
| D17 | Dynamic-name runtime interner, opt-in, bounded (§14) | **Keep** **[FP]** | Uncontroversial; the references' dynamic naming needs are covered. |
| D18 | Fixed-size POD `TraceEvent`, side-channel for variable payloads (§13) | **Keep, add counts (C2)** **[FP+R]** | Add per-event fields/derivation for invocation counting; keep the record small. |

Nothing is classified **Remove** outright — the baseline contained no dead weight. The only
**Replace** is the incorrect same-thread claim (D13). Two **Postpone** (GPU D14, Memory
D15) were already deferred and remain so.

---

## 3. Step 2 — Every useful reference idea, evaluated

Applying the 8-question test (problem / do we solve it / is it better / runtime cost /
build cost / complexity / external-tool coverage / unique-semantics justification). Only
favorable tradeoffs are adopted.

### Adopted **[R→adopt]**

| Idea (source) | Problem | Already solved? | Better? | Runtime cost | Build cost | Complexity | External tool? | Unique semantics? | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Invocation counts / calls-per-frame** (R, H) | Is it more work or slower work? Behavioral bugs (2×/0× execution). | Partially (durations only). | Yes — orthogonal signal. | ~free (increment during off-line aggregation, or one field). | none. | Low. | Perfetto shows slice counts; but the *engine* names the scope. | Yes. | **Adopt** as first-class (C2). |
| **Inclusive vs exclusive, explicitly defined** (R child-subtraction, H) | "Time" is ambiguous; nested work double-counts. | Baseline implied it; not defined. | Yes. | Derived off-line (no hot-path cost). | none. | Low–Med (define union-of-children on one context). | Perfetto renders slices; *definitions* are ours. | Yes. | **Adopt** as analysis contract (C1, §5 here). |
| **Caller-context ≠ site identity** (H) | Same routine under load vs frame-update differs. | No (baseline hashed site only). | Yes for attribution. | Off-line reconstruction from begin/end order; no hot-path cost. | none. | Med (context is derived, not stored per node). | Perfetto flows/tracks help; semantics ours. | Yes. | **Adopt** (C3). |
| **Explicit "unlogged remainder"** (H) | Makes incomplete instrumentation visible. | No. | Yes — cheap honesty. | none (analysis-time). | none. | Low. | n/a. | Yes. | **Adopt** in analysis output. |
| **Provenance-at-free for memory** (L) | Attribute a free to its allocation origin across threads/scopes. | No (memory deferred). | Yes — the core memory insight. | Allocator-side metadata read at free. | n/a (allocator). | Med. | heaptrack does allocation capture; engine tags/domains are ours. | Yes. | **Adopt** into memory design (C4, §7 here). |
| **Live-usage vs allocation-churn as distinct metrics** (L) | Stable live bytes can hide heavy alloc/free traffic. | No. | Yes. | Counters. | n/a. | Low. | heaptrack partially. | Yes (engine tags). | **Adopt** into memory design. |
| **Statistical-window discipline** (R decaying extrema counter-example; E windows) | Misleading stats hide hitches / shift with denominator. | No (baseline said "moving median" loosely). | Yes — correctness. | none. | none. | Low. | n/a. | n/a. | **Adopt** as rule (C6, D11). |
| **Category/group as capture-and-display axis, separate from site** (E) | Teams need focused views without coordinating every probe. | Baseline had optional category metadata. | Yes — separate *capture* enable from *display* filter. | none hot-path (metadata). | none. | Low. | Perfetto category selection. | Partial. | **Adopt**: category is metadata + capture policy, distinct from display filter. |
| **Clock-correctness-before-speed** (E/H negative example) | Wrong tick semantics corrupt durations. | Baseline chose steady_clock. | Yes — make it a gate. | n/a. | n/a. | Low. | n/a. | n/a. | **Adopt** as gate (C7, D12). |
| **Same-thread pairing is a contract, not a guarantee; use flows for migration** (L TLS + cross-thread free; review §7.2) | Coroutine/job migration breaks lexical pairing. | No (baseline over-claimed). | Yes — correctness. | none (design). | none. | Low now; Med when jobs land. | Perfetto flow events. | Yes. | **Adopt** (C5). |
| **Remote inspection for headless/devkit** (L) | Inspect without a large in-game viewer; headless targets. | Baseline: external-first export. | Complementary. | Bounded transport. | none in core. | Med (out of core). | Tracy is exactly this. | Partial. | **Adopt** posture: prefer Tracy/remote over in-engine UI (already baseline direction). |

### Rejected **[R→reject]** (copied verbatim would harm us)

| Rejected mechanism (source) | Why rejected |
| --- | --- |
| Global name-array scan + parent inference from start times (R) | O(active names) per begin/end; merges caller contexts; no concurrency model. Superseded by hashed sites + off-line nesting from explicit begin/end order. |
| Single-precision seconds absolute timestamps (R) | Subtracting large rounded floats loses short-interval precision as uptime grows. We keep integer ticks, convert durations only for display. |
| Decaying extrema presented as generic min/max (R) | Can conceal an earlier hitch and implies statistics not computed. Banned (C6). |
| FourCC as the organizing namespace (E) | Manual tiny namespace, encoding pitfalls; no benefit over hashed descriptors + categories. |
| Name registration/lookup on every timed use (E) | Makes probe cost scale with registry/string work; E itself cautions against it. We register once, store the id. |
| `RDTSC` + CPU-MHz/sleep calibration as the clock (E, H) | Not a sufficient modern contract (ordering, frequency meaning, migration, portability). Gate C7. |
| Resetting measurement state inside `DrawCounters` / draw-time reset (E) | Collection semantics must not depend on rendering being visible/present. Frames are markers, not resets (D7). |
| One shared `CurrentNode` (H) | Concurrent execution interleaves unrelated stacks; a lock can't make them one meaningful stack. Per-thread buffers + derived trees instead. |
| Hot-path child-list search + first-encounter node allocation (H) | Cost grows with sibling count; allocates exactly when a new scene first runs (cold-path disturbance). Producer records fixed POD events only. |
| Raw string-literal *pointer* as universal semantic identity (H, L) | Static lifetime ≠ unique/canonical identity across sites/modules; raw pointers aren't persistent capture identifiers. We use hashed site ids + separate context. |
| Hand-written x86 binary patching / trampolines as the allocator seam (L) | Makes allocator correctness depend on code relocation and executable-memory handling; poor coverage/portability. Use explicit allocator hooks (we own the allocator). |
| Embedding memory records/loss in the CPU Trace stream (implied by naive sharing) | A lost free permanently corrupts live-byte reconstruction; Trace's drop policy is unsafe for memory (C4). |
| Treating a shared CPU/memory scope tree as one runtime subsystem (H+L blend) | Memory state outlives threads/captures; CPU interval state has different completion/loss rules (review §5.3, §6). |
| Borrowed "under 5% enabled / <1% disabled" acceptance targets (E) | Historical goals aren't evidence of acceptable perturbation at modern event rates/frame deadlines. We define our own gates by measurement (§12). |

---

## 4. Step 3 — Layering discipline (protect against inflation)

Firm boundaries; a capability lives in exactly one layer and does **not** migrate inward
just because it shares a UI or a clock with another. **[FP+R]**

```text
┌ INSTRUMENTATION (must be trivially cheap, ubiquitous, header-only-cheap) ─────────────┐
│   CPU scopes · counters · GPU markers (later) · allocation tag/site (allocator-side)   │
│   → hashed site id + category; RAII; compile-out; NO storage/UI/platform in the header │
├ RECORDING (per-thread, lock-free, fixed POD) ─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Trace: per-thread chunked ring of TraceEvent (event stream = ground truth)           │
│   Counters: per-thread scalar shards                                                   │
│   Memory: allocator-owned provenance metadata + activity records (SEPARATE contract)   │
├ CAPTURE / AGGREGATION (off hot path; one collector; AsyncBackend lifetime discipline) ─┤
│   drain chunks · own string table · rolling window · hitch trigger · counter snapshots │
├ ANALYSIS (off-line / off-process; convenience over hot-path speed) ────────────────────┤
│   derive hierarchy tree · inclusive/exclusive · calls/frame · unlogged remainder ·     │
│   caller-context grouping · statistical windows (named) · critical-path (later)        │
├ VISUALIZATION (mostly external; tiny in-engine overlay only) ──────────────────────────┤
│   Perfetto/Chrome JSON · Tracy (live) · tiny counters+top-N overlay                     │
└ SPECIALIZED PROFILERS (own data models; may share transport/UI, never ownership) ──────┘
    Memory profiler (allocator)   ·   GPU profiler (RHI)   ·   (future) asset-streaming
```

Rules that prevent inflation:
- **Analysis never runs on the hot path.** Trees, inclusive/exclusive, counts-per-frame,
  and stats are computed in the collector/exporter/viewer, from the event stream.
- **Sharing a viewer or a clock does not mean sharing buffers, backpressure, or exactness
  guarantees** (review §6). Memory's lossless needs never leak into Trace's drop policy,
  and vice versa.
- **The instrumentation header stays under the CI build budget** (ADR 0005); specialized
  profilers pull their heavy deps into their own `.cpp`/modules.

---

## 5. Step 4 — In-game vs external visualization (final position)

**Decision: external-first, with a deliberately tiny in-engine overlay. [FP+R]** The
historical emphasis on in-game visualization was a product of its era (no good external
tools, a serial frame loop, a text renderer at hand). Modern workflows invalidate it as a
*default*.

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **In-game overlay** | Zero context switch; works on devkit; good for QA/designers (R's insight). | Requires the renderer/UI under test; limited screen area; high maintenance for rich views; can perturb the very frame it measures (R's own text-render-in-graphics-interval pitfall). | **Tiny only**: counters + top-N scopes as text/HUD. No interactive timeline. |
| **Editor-integrated profiler** | Rich, contextual. | No editor exists (and none planned soon); large surface; duplicates Perfetto. | **Reject for now**; likely never. |
| **Standalone profiler app** | Full control. | We'd rebuild Perfetto/Tracy; huge cost. | **Reject** (build-vs-buy, review §7.5). |
| **External trace viewer (Perfetto)** | Free, powerful, universal, multi-monitor, remote-friendly, no engine UI code; opens exported captures anywhere. | Post-hoc (unless Tracy-live); needs a schema/export. | **Primary.** |
| **Live external (Tracy)** | Real-time, purpose-built for this instrumentation style, remote, low integration. | External dependency; must validate cost. | **Adopt as optional live backend** (Phase 3). |
| **Hybrid (overlay + export + optional Tracy)** | Immediate glanceable feedback *and* deep off-line/live analysis; matches remote/headless/automated capture. | Two consumers to keep coherent (mitigated: both read the same collector output). | **Chosen.** |

Modern-workflow drivers (all favor external/hybrid): multi-monitor and remote dev make an
external viewer *more* convenient than an overlay; console/devkit testing needs remote
capture (Tracy/exported files); **headless** workloads (already a Ludus platform backend)
have no screen at all — the overlay is meaningless there, and only export/remote works;
automated captures (CI hitch triggers) must produce *files*, not pixels. Therefore: **the
runtime engine renders only a minimal counters/top-N overlay; all timelines, flame charts,
memory graphs, and comparisons live in external tools.**

---

## 6. Step 5 — Hierarchical profiling: a derived view, not the record (C1)

**Ground truth = a per-thread stream of timestamped begin/end/instant/flow events. The
hierarchical tree is reconstructed off-line. [FP+R]** The references make this decisive:

- H's mutable runtime tree with a shared `CurrentNode` "retains where a sample occurred in
  instrumented context, not the temporal order of all invocations" and cannot represent
  concurrent stacks (review §4.4). R's flat-array parent inference from start-time ordering
  is unreliable under ties/precision and merges callers (review §2.4).
- For modern workloads the tree is **one view, not the ground truth**: across workers,
  summing elapsed durations can exceed frame wall time; subtracting async worker time from
  a dispatching scope is not valid exclusive time; the **critical path requires
  scheduling/dependency evidence a tree summary does not carry** (review §7.2).

Representation decisions:
- **Per-execution-context nesting** is reconstructed from each thread's begin/end ordering
  (matched by lexical pairing *within a thread*). This yields the familiar tree **per
  thread**, off-line, at no hot-path cost.
- **Caller-context sensitivity** (H's genuine contribution) is available as an analysis
  grouping (path = sequence of enclosing site ids), computed in the viewer/collector — not
  stored as nodes on the hot path (C3).
- **Cross-thread / job / async / GPU-queue relationships** are represented by **flow
  events** (a `flow_id` linking a producer event to a consumer event), *not* by a single
  scope spanning contexts. This is the seam for the reserved `JobId` (D16) and for GPU
  queues (D14). A tree is not forced where a DAG/timeline is the truth.
- **Inclusive vs exclusive** are defined precisely (C2): *inclusive* = entry→exit interval;
  *exclusive* = inclusive minus the union of nested synchronous child intervals **on the
  same context**. Neither equals scheduled CPU time (waits/preemption remain) — stated
  explicitly in output so no one misreads elapsed as CPU time (review §7.2).
- **Incomplete/malformed nesting** (crash, dropped chunk, coroutine): the builder tolerates
  unmatched begin/end, and **marks synthesized closures as such** — a fabricated
  chunk-boundary end is labeled "incomplete," never reported as a measured duration
  (review §8). "Unlogged remainder" is shown to expose instrumentation gaps.

---

## 7. Step 6 — Memory profiling ownership (C4)

**The allocator owns allocation correctness and provenance; a separate memory-profiler
module owns rich capture/analysis; neither is the CPU Trace. [R→adopt]** This corrects the
baseline §10 wording ("feeds the *same* capture infrastructure").

Originates **in the allocator** (foundation, when it exists):
- Allocation identity, size, alignment, allocator/**tag** (compile-time-hashed, same scheme
  as zones), and a compact **origin token** (return address and/or current context id)
  stored as allocation metadata so **free can charge the origin** across threads and after
  the allocating thread exits (L's core insight). Aligned-payload and full-size contracts
  are the allocator's responsibility (review §5.4).
- Foundational totals + high-water marks (a few atomics) — cheap enough to keep in **all**
  builds incl. Release (baseline §20 tier).

Owned by the **memory-profiler module** (optional, dev/capture-only):
- **Four separate questions**, per review §6, each with its own records — never conflated:
  1. **Capacity** (requested/live vs reserved vs committed vs resident — different metrics).
  2. **Activity** (allocs/frees per interval, sizes, short-lived churn) — distinct from live
     totals; 1,000 alloc+free in a frame ends at zero live but is real activity.
  3. **Lifetime & attribution** (origin, current owner/tag, thread/task, capture boundary;
     pointer reuse must not conflate lifetimes).
  4. **Allocator efficiency** (fragmentation, free-space layout) — needs allocator-specific
     evidence beyond live bytes.
- **Loss semantics are lossless-or-explicitly-marked**, *not* Trace's silent drop: a lost
  free permanently corrupts live-byte reconstruction, so a bounded memory stream must, on
  overflow, **mark the affected analysis incomplete and re-establish a known snapshot** (or
  switch to a defined sampled mode). This is the single most important divergence from
  Trace (review §6).

Explicitly **not** adopted: binary patching/trampolines (we own the allocator → explicit
hooks), embedding a `pointer+int` header exactly as printed (alignment/failure/lifetime
unhandled), one-critical-section-per-origin as a scalability claim (measure contention).

Capture-mode overhead reality (review §5.4): per-allocation records + prefix metadata are
expensive (illustratively, 16 B metadata × 1M live allocs = 16 MB before tree/rounding) →
**tag totals always-on; per-alloc capture is opt-in capture-only; call-stack symbolization
is off-line, never on the hot path.** Delegate broad heap analysis to **heaptrack** where
it suffices; the engine adds only what needs its tags/domains (review §7.5).

**No duplicate tracking system:** there is exactly one allocation-tracking source (the
allocator); the profiler is a *consumer* of allocator events/metadata.

---

## 8. Step 7 — Revised target architecture

Differences from baseline are tagged inline. The layered flow (§4) is the structure; this
adds thread interactions, ownership, and the derived-view rule.

```text
INSTRUMENTATION (public header ≤ log.hpp build budget)
  LUDUS_PROFILE_SCOPE/FUNCTION/FRAME/COUNT/GAUGE/MARK   [+ GPU_SCOPE later]
  → constexpr {siteId (FNV-1a), category} descriptor + non-template RAII ScopedZone
  → optional flow_id begin/end for cross-context links            ◄── C3, C5 (flows)
        │  NowTicks()  (shared steady_clock ns; TSC only past gate C7)
        ▼
RECORDING  (per producer thread, TLS; single-writer, no atomics on push)
  Trace: chunked ring of fixed POD TraceEvent  ── EVENT STREAM IS GROUND TRUTH  ◄── C1
         (Kind: Begin|End|Instant|FrameMark|FlowOut|FlowIn|GpuBegin|GpuEnd)
  Counters: per-thread scalar shards
  [Memory: allocator-owned provenance metadata + activity records — SEPARATE, lossless ◄── C4]
  full chunk / frame-flip ──► DV-style bounded MPSC chunk queue (reused from logging)
        ▼
CAPTURE / AGGREGATION  (one collector; AsyncBackend stop/join discipline; §21)
  drain chunks · own authoritative string table · rolling window (pre/post-trigger) ·
  hitch trigger (collector-side, no producer cost) · per-frame counter snapshots
        ▼
ANALYSIS  (off-line / off-process; convenience > speed)          ◄── C1, C2, C6
  per-thread nesting → tree (DERIVED) · inclusive/exclusive (defined) ·
  calls/frame · caller-context grouping · unlogged remainder ·
  named statistical windows (no decaying extrema) · flows → job/GPU correlation
        ▼
VISUALIZATION
  Perfetto/Chrome JSON (primary) · Tracy live (optional) · tiny overlay (counters + top-N)
```

- **Hot-path behavior [FP]:** timestamp + relaxed TLS stores into the current chunk; no
  lock/alloc/string/tree.
- **Thread interactions [FP]:** producers ↔ collector only via the lock-free chunk queue;
  memory metadata is allocator-local (charged at free via origin token, C4).
- **Ownership [FP+R]:** thread owns its buffer; collector owns shared/export state;
  allocator owns allocation metadata. No shared `CurrentNode` **[R→reject]**.
- **Memory model [FP]:** fixed, pre-reserved; Trace drops-with-count on overflow; **memory
  stream marks-incomplete instead of silently dropping [R→adopt C4]**.
- **Identity [R→adopt C3]:** three axes — site (hashed id), caller-context (derived path),
  category (metadata + capture policy). Collision-checked in Development; widen to 64-bit if
  it ever bites (event field is the only change).

---

## 9. Step 8 — Final instrumentation API

Compact, orthogonal. Names illustrative. For each: enabled behavior / disabled behavior /
expression evaluation / event cost / metadata cost / compile-time cost.

```cpp
#include <ludus/profiling/profiling.hpp>   // ≤ log.hpp build budget (ADR 0005)

// 2. Function scope — name derived from source_location

// 3. Frame marker — boundary + advances frame epoch (not a reset) (D7)
LUDUS_PROFILE_FRAME();

// 4. Counter / gauge — scalar; Count accumulates within frame, Gauge sets instantaneous (D8)
LUDUS_PROFILE_COUNT(DrawCalls, n);
LUDUS_PROFILE_GAUGE(PendingJobs, pending);

// 5. Instant marker — zero-duration annotation

| API | Enabled build | Disabled build | Expression eval | Event cost | Metadata cost | Compile-time cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PROFILE_SCOPE` | ctor Begin + dtor End into TLS chunk | expands to `((void)0)`; name token **not** evaluated | name is a *token* (stringized once), not evaluated at runtime | 2× `NowTicks` + ~6–8 stores + 1 predicted branch | one `constexpr` descriptor per **site** (not per hit) | 1 constexpr hash + 1 POD; no template instantiation, no heavy include |
| `PROFILE_FUNCTION` | as SCOPE, name from `source_location` | `((void)0)` | none | same as SCOPE | descriptor uses compile-time `source_location` | same |
| `PROFILE_FRAME` | emit FrameMark + bump epoch | `((void)0)` | none | 1 event | none | trivial |
| `PROFILE_COUNT` | 1 relaxed atomic add to a shard | `((void)0)`; **value arg not evaluated** | value **is** evaluated only when enabled | ~few ns | one counter handle | trivial |
| `PROFILE_GAUGE` | 1 relaxed store to a shard | `((void)0)`; value not evaluated | value evaluated only when enabled | ~few ns | one handle | trivial |
| `PROFILE_MARK` | 1 Instant event | `((void)0)` | none | 1 event | one descriptor | trivial |
| `PROFILE_FLOW_OUT/IN` | emit Flow event with id | `((void)0)`; returns 0 | none | 1 event | none | trivial |
| `PROFILE_GPU_SCOPE` | 2 query writes into cmd + 1 CPU pending entry | `((void)0)` | `cmd` evaluated only when enabled | no GPU stall; deferred readback | descriptor per pass | trivial (impl in `.cpp`) |

Six core concepts (scope, frame, counter/gauge, mark, flow, gpu) — deliberately **not**
twenty macros. Category, color, and dynamic name are optional arguments/overloads, not new
macros. **[FP]** with flow added **[R→adopt C5]**.

Design rule enforced by a gate (§12): the disabled expansion must evaluate **no argument**
(so a `PROFILE_COUNT(DrawCalls, ExpensiveRecount())` costs nothing when disabled) and emit
**zero instructions** — verified on the generated code, echoing R's/E's compile-out intent
but held to a measured standard, not a borrowed percentage **[R→reject borrowed targets]**.

---

## 10. Step 9 — Runtime event representation (data format)

Optimize for cheap writes; analysis convenience is secondary. **[FP]**, with count/flow
fields **[R→adopt]**.

```cpp
struct TraceEvent            // POD, trivially copyable; target 16–24 B (gate §12)
{
    uint64 Ticks;            // monotonic steady_clock ns (§/C7); integer, never float
    uint32 SiteId;           // compile-time FNV-1a of the site → ZoneRegistry (C3)
    uint16 Kind;             // Begin|End|Instant|FrameMark|FlowOut|FlowIn|GpuBegin|GpuEnd
    uint16 Flags;            // has-flow, has-category, incomplete(synthesized), queue bits
    // Variable / optional payloads live in a PARALLEL side-channel stream keyed by index,
    // so the common event stays small and cache-hot:
    //   FlowId (uint64)  — for FlowOut/In and job/GPU correlation (C5, D16)
    //   CategoryId       — when Flags say so (C3)
};
```

- **Event types [FP+R]:** Begin/End (paired *within a thread*, C5), Instant, FrameMark,
  Flow (cross-context link — the modern replacement for a spanning scope, C1), GPU begin/end
  (later). No "tree node" type — the tree is derived (C1).
- **Timestamps [FP+R→reject float]:** integer `steady_clock` ns; durations computed by
  subtraction; wall-clock derived off-line via the logging `SessionClockAnchor`. Never
  single-precision seconds (R's precision-loss failure).
- **Name IDs [R→adopt C3]:** events carry `SiteId` only; names live once in `ZoneRegistry`.
  **Caller-context** and **category** are *separate* axes, not folded into the site id.
- **Thread IDs [FP]:** reuse logging's `uint32 ThreadId` + `SetCurrentThreadName`; the
  buffer partition *is* the thread, so the id is metadata on the chunk, not per event.
- **Payloads [FP]:** side-channel parallel stream for optional/variable data; keeps the hot
  record fixed-size and branch-free to append.
- **String table [FP]:** collector owns the authoritative id→{name,file,line,category}
  table; serialized once per export. No strings copied at the site (contrast R's 256-char
  inline names, **[R→reject]**).
- **Alignment [FP+R]:** 8-byte aligned, power-of-two record; chunk-aligned ring so a push
  touches the producer's own cache lines only.
- **Buffer ownership [FP]:** TLS per thread; chunks pre-allocated (≥2 for double-buffering);
  handed to the collector via the DV-MPSC chunk queue.
- **Serialization [FP+R]:** off the hot path in the collector/exporter (Perfetto JSON
  first). **Memory records are a different schema in a different stream** (C4), never
  interleaved into this one.

## 11. Step 10 — Final feature boundary

| Capability | Build now | Later | External tool | Reject | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CPU scope profiler** | ✅ | | | | Core value; only the engine names scopes. **[FP]** |
| **Hierarchical timing** | ✅ (derived view) | | | | Ground truth is the event stream; tree reconstructed off-line (C1). Producer-side tree **rejected**. |
| **Invocation counts / calls-per-frame** | ✅ | | | | Distinguishes work amount vs cost; cheap (C2). **[R→adopt]** |
| **Inclusive/exclusive (defined)** | ✅ (analysis) | | | | Prevents double-counting; defined, not ambiguous (C2). **[R→adopt]** |
| **Counters / gauges** | ✅ (Phase 2) | | | | Cheap always-on scalars; separate from timed scopes (D8). **[FP+R]** |
| **Timeline / flame-chart viewer** | | | ✅ Perfetto/Tracy | | Solved externally; multi-monitor/remote/headless friendly (§5). **[FP+R]** |
| **Tiny in-engine overlay (counters+top-N)** | ✅ (Phase 2) | | | | Glanceable dev feedback; not an interactive timeline (§5). **[FP]** |
| **Hitch capture (ring + pre/post trigger)** | ✅ (Phase 3) | | | | Retains temporal evidence historical summaries lack (D9). **[FP+R]** |
| **Perfetto/Chrome export** | ✅ (Phase 1) | | | | Universal; primary viewer path. **[FP+R]** |
| **Tracy integration (live)** | | ✅ (Phase 3) | ✅ | | Best live UX; validate cost first (§5, [?meas]). **[FP+R]** |
| **Flow events (job/async correlation)** | ✅ (primitive now) | ⏳ (scheduler stamping when jobs exist) | | | Cross-context truth is a DAG, not a spanning scope (C1, C5, D16). **[R→adopt]** |
| **GPU profiling (timestamp queries)** | | ⏳ (needs RHI) | RenderDoc/PIX/Nsight for capture | | Engine does pass *timing*; tools do per-draw/pixel (D14). **[FP+R]** |
| **PIX / vendor debug markers** | | ✅ (with GPU scope) | ✅ | | Near-free; annotates vendor captures with our pass names. **[FP]** |
| **Memory tracking (tag totals)** | ⏳ (needs allocator; always-on tier) | | | | Cheap atomics; keep in all builds (C4, §7). **[FP+R]** |
| **Memory provenance / live-vs-churn / activity** | | ⏳ (memory-profiler module) | heaptrack for broad heap | | Provenance-at-free is L's core insight; own tags/domains (C4). **[R→adopt]** |
| **Allocation call stacks** | | ⏳ (opt-in capture-only, off-line symbolized) | heaptrack | | Expensive; never hot-path symbolization (§7). **[R→adopt bounded]** |
| **Remote profiler** | | ✅ (via Tracy/exported files) | ✅ | | Headless/devkit need it; don't build bespoke transport (§5). **[FP+R]** |
| **Capture files** | ✅ (Phase 1, Perfetto JSON) | ✅ (compact binary if volume demands) | | | Files are the automation/CI artifact. **[FP]** |
| **Statistical sampling** | | | ✅ perf/VTune/Superluminal | | Sees inlined/library frames we can't; complements our scopes (§1, review §7.5). **[FP+R]** |
| **In-engine interactive timeline UI** | | | | ❌ | Requires renderer/UI under test; duplicates Perfetto; huge maintenance (§5). **[R-era assumption rejected]** |
| **Producer-side mutable call tree (shared CurrentNode)** | | | | ❌ | No concurrency model; hot-path alloc/search (C1). **[R→reject]** |
| **Binary-patch allocator interception** | | | | ❌ | We own the allocator → explicit hooks; patching is unportable/unsafe (§7). **[R→reject]** |

---

## 12. Step 11 — Final staged roadmap

Each phase delivers usable optimization capability; no phase requires "the whole profiler"
to exist first. **[FP]**, resequenced so the reference-driven semantics (counts,
inclusive/exclusive, honest stats) land *with* the first CPU trace, not after.

| Phase | Delivers | Depends on | Value | Complexity | Perf risk | Gate to pass (see §13) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0. Shared clock** | Promote `NowTicks()` to foundation; ticks→ns; monotonicity/ordering contract | — | Enables all | Low | Low | Clock read cost; monotonic & ordered across threads (C7) |
| **1. CPU Trace MVP + Perfetto export** | `SCOPE/FUNCTION/FRAME`, TLS chunk ring, `ZoneRegistry`, collector, **derived tree**, **inclusive/exclusive + calls/frame + unlogged remainder**, Perfetto JSON | Phase 0, MPSC queue (exists) | **Highest** — "where did the frame go," honestly | Med | Med (hot-path push) | Scope overhead; disabled = 0 codegen; multi-thread flood; tree/incl-excl correctness; **captures load in ui.perfetto.dev**; header build budget |
| **2. Counters + tiny overlay** | `COUNT/GAUGE/MARK`, per-frame snapshot, named windows, text HUD | Phase 1 | High — cheap always-on trends | Low–Med | Low | Counter contention; **every stat names window+denominator (C6)**; snapshot correctness under overlapping frame flip |
| **3. Hitch capture (+ optional Tracy)** | Rolling ring, trigger policy, auto-export; optional Tracy live backend | Phase 1 | High — catch unexpected spikes | Med | Low (off hot path) | Pre-trigger survives overload; **export doesn't induce a second hitch**; Tracy cost measured before adoption ([?meas]) |
| **4. Flow correlation** | Scheduler stamps `flow_id`; job/async DAG view | **Job system (not yet)** | High once jobs exist | Med | Low | Flow linkage correctness across migration; no hot-path cost added |
| **5. GPU Trace** | `GPU_SCOPE`, query pools, deferred readback, vendor labels | **RHI (Milestone 2+)** | High once GPU exists | High | Med (no stalls) | No GPU stall; N-in-flight readback correctness; CPU-vs-GPU time not conflated |
| **6. Memory profiler** | Allocator provenance + tag totals (all builds); activity/live/lifetime (dev); per-alloc capture (opt-in, off-line symbols) | **Allocator (Milestone ?)** | High for mem bugs | High | Med (capture mode) | Lossless-or-marked semantics (C4); cross-thread free accounting; capture-mode overhead bounded |

Ship **0→1** first: that alone makes the engine meaningfully easier to optimize (semantic
frame attribution + honest inclusive/exclusive/counts + a universal viewer). Phases 4–6 are
gated on subsystems that do not yet exist and are co-designed with them.

---

## 13. Step 12 — Validation gates (what to measure; decisions that depend on it)

No borrowed numbers **[R→reject E's targets]**; each gate states *what* to benchmark and
*which architectural choice it decides*.

| Gate | Measure | Decision it drives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **G1 Disabled codegen** | Assembly of a disabled `SCOPE`/`COUNT`; confirm zero instructions and **no argument evaluation** | If not zero → fix the macro before anything ships (§9). |
| **G2 Enabled scope overhead** | ns/scope (begin+end), identical optimized workload, idle vs recording | Sets whether `steady_clock` dominates → whether to pursue TSC (C7/G7). |
| **G3 Clock** | `NowTicks` cost; monotonicity & cross-thread ordering; resolution | Gate C7: TSC backend only if G2 shows clock dominates **and** ordering/frequency/migration contract holds. |
| **G4 Throughput / saturation** | events/sec across N threads; per-thread buffer throughput; drop rate at saturation; TSan-clean | Chunk size, ring depth, collector topology (dedicated thread vs piggy-back logging worker) [?meas]. |
| **G5 Memory footprint** | Per-thread buffer + collector rolling-window bytes at default config; retained-window cost at realistic event rates (the review's 240 MB/s arithmetic is a warning, not a default) | Default window size; aggregate-vs-event retention tradeoff. |
| **G6 Capture size & load** | Perfetto JSON size for a representative capture; loads in `ui.perfetto.dev`; hierarchy/incl-excl/counts match expectation | When (if) a compact binary format is worth building (D18). |
| **G7 Counter contention** | Hot counter (e.g. DrawCalls) single-atomic vs per-thread shard | Whether counters need sharding (D8). |
| **G8 Build-time** | `profiling.hpp` self-parse under CI `-ftime-trace`; must sit under its budget line | Fails the CI gate if a heavy include sneaks in (ADR 0005, D2). |
| **G9 Code-size** | `.text`/metadata growth per 1000 sites; Release binary delta (near-zero when compiled out) | Confirms descriptor-per-site (not per-hit) and clean compile-out. |
| **G10 Observer effect (whole-system)** | Instrumentation off / idle / recording / recording+export / recording+overlay on the *same* optimized workload; tail frame times, not just a micro-loop | Whether recording/collector/overlay perturbs the very thing measured (R/E warning; review §7.4). |
| **G11 GPU query overhead** (Phase 5) | Query write cost; confirm **no** synchronous readback / stall | Query-pool sizing; keeps "no GPU stall for profiling" true. |
| **G12 Allocator tracking cost** (Phase 6) | tag-total atomics on alloc/free; per-alloc capture-mode overhead; cross-thread-free contention | Which memory tiers are always-on vs capture-only (C4, §7). |
| **G13 Incomplete-capture honesty** | Force drops/crash mid-scope; verify synthesized closures are **labeled incomplete** and memory gaps **mark analysis incomplete** (never silent) | Validates C1/C4 loss semantics. |

Open questions explicitly left to measurement **[?meas]**: TSC vs steady_clock (G2/G3);
event size vs richness with flow/category inline vs side-channel (G4/G5); collector topology
(G4); counter sharding (G7); Tracy backend cost (Phase 3); compact binary threshold (G6).

## Final deliverable — provenance summary

**What came from first-principles reasoning [FP], retained:** three independent subsystems;
cheap-to-include header with type-erased `.cpp`; compile-time-gated RAII scopes with
zero-code disabled path; per-thread chunked lock-free buffers + off-path collector reusing
the logging `AsyncBackend` lifetime discipline and DV-MPSC queue; frame markers (not
resets); event stream as the record; Perfetto-first external visualization with a tiny
overlay; deferring GPU (RHI) and memory (allocator); reserved `JobId`/flow seam;
fixed-size POD events with a side-channel for payloads; `steady_clock` ns now.

**What was improved by the historical references [R→adopt / FP+R]:** (C1) hierarchy is
firmly a *derived* off-line view, cross-context work uses **flow events** not spanning
scopes; (C2) **invocation counts** and **explicitly defined inclusive/exclusive** become
first-class; (C3) identity split into **site / caller-context / category**; (C4) memory
profiling severed from Trace's transport and drop policy, given **provenance-at-free**, a
**lossless/marked-incomplete** contract, and four separate metric families, owned with the
allocator; (C5) the false "RAII enforces same-thread" claim **corrected** to a contract +
flows; (C6) **statistical windows/denominators named**, decaying extrema banned, smoothed
UI separated from exact hitch evidence; (C7) **clock correctness elevated to a gate** before
any TSC work; plus the "unlogged remainder" honesty output and the whole-system observer-
effect gate.

**What the references offered but we deliberately rejected [R→reject]:** global name-array
scans and start-time parent inference (R); single-precision-seconds timestamps (R); decaying
extrema as generic min/max (R); FourCC namespace and per-use name lookup (E); RDTSC+CPU-MHz/
sleep calibration as the clock (E/H); draw-time reset of measurement state (E); one shared
`CurrentNode` and hot-path tree allocation/search (H); raw string-literal-pointer as
universal identity (H/L); hand-written binary patching/trampolines as the allocator seam and
the printed `pointer+int` header (L); embedding memory records in the CPU trace stream with
Trace's drop policy (L blend); and borrowed fixed overhead-percentage acceptance targets (E).

**What remains uncertain and requires measurement [?meas]:** TSC vs `steady_clock` (G2/G3);
event size vs richness / inline vs side-channel for flow & category (G4/G5); collector
topology — dedicated thread vs piggy-backing the logging worker (G4); counter sharding (G7);
Tracy live-backend cost before adoption (Phase 3); the compact-binary export threshold (G6);
and the true whole-system observer effect (G10). Architectural commitments in these areas
are deferred until the corresponding gate produces evidence.

This architecture is optimized for **Ludus** — its `-fno-exceptions`/no-RTTI foundation,
its logging-proven lock-free patterns, its build-time budgets, its build flavors, and its
current absence of a job system, renderer, and allocator — not for reproducing any of the
four historical systems. The references sharpened its *semantics and honesty*; they did not
change its *shape*.
```

Now let me verify the document and reconcile it against the frozen baseline to make sure my change-tracking is accurate.
