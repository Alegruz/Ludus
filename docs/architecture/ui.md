# Runtime UI architecture

Status: U0 implemented in `Ludus::Ui`. U1-U4 below are a delivery plan,
not implemented capabilities. Sandbox consumes U0 through the installed SDK.

## Decision and current constraints

Use a small, renderer-independent, bounded document resolver with retained
interaction state and game-owned data. Submit plain value descriptions; resolve
layout once; route ordered events against that exact layout; apply returned
actions; consume paint and semantic geometry. There are no widget inheritance
hierarchies, callbacks into game code, pointers as identities, ECS dependency,
implicit global context, script VM, or platform objects in the core.

The current RHI admits one fullscreen draw, no sampled textures, vertex/index
buffers or scissor API. Native `Ludus::Text` owns shaping/rasterization; its web
bootstrap and GPU atlas are pending. The Editor uses Qt. Browser game controls
already use accessible DOM. Those boundaries determine the first delivery:
solid rectangles, layout, focus and pointer ownership, plus a real HUD consumer.
General UI rendering and text input require subsequent capabilities.

A AAA production UI must eventually support shaping/bidi/fallback, IME,
controller navigation, accessibility, localization, virtualized lists, animation,
authoring and inspection. Calling U0 a complete AAA toolkit would be misleading.
Its value is a small tested foundation and a migration seam that does not require
those systems to be invented simultaneously.

## Alternatives considered

| Approach | Strength | Decision for Ludus now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qt for editor and DOM for browser forms | Existing native controls, input methods and accessibility | Keep these adapters for their current surfaces. Do not port the Editor to a game HUD toolkit. |
| Dear ImGui | Established debug UI API, game-owned data | Suitable as a future optional developer overlay. Introducing it now still requires rendering capabilities absent from the current RHI; it does not remove the player UI requirements. |
| RmlUi | Established document/style and renderer boundary | Re-evaluate for complex authored screens once the renderer/text adapter exists. Avoid duplicating a complete rich document engine in U0. |
| Fully custom retained widget/object hierarchy | Flexible arbitrary behavior | Reject initially: ownership, callbacks, state synchronization and invalidation increase the maintenance surface. |
| Bounded value documents plus retained focus/capture | Small explicit contracts; reusable across current render/platform constraints | Adopt for U0 HUDs and simple controls, with deliberate feature limits and a measured expansion path. |

## Baseline before the Gems review

1. Application models remain the source of truth. Documents are immutable value
   snapshots, and actions carry stable IDs back to the application.
2. Keep a persistent surface context for focus and capture, rather than retaining
   the application's data or rebuilding interaction state each frame.
3. Separate layout, events, painting, text services and platform bridges. Qt
   continues to serve desktop authoring; DOM continues to serve browser input.
4. Use logical pixels, deterministic flow/anchors and bounded storage. Avoid
   general CSS, global constraint solvers and a new dependency tree initially.
5. Make geometry and commands inspectable and GPU-free to test. Optimize based
   on captures and counters; do not promise performance without measurements.

This API/implementation separation follows the [Dear ImGui author's discussion](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/About-the-IMGUI-paradigm):
immediate submission can coexist with persistent internal state. The
[RmlUi render interface](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/render.html)
also demonstrates a useful boundary between UI output and renderer resources.
These support the separation, not an assertion that U0 matches either toolkit's
feature coverage or speed.

## Gems review and resulting changes

The index is a discovery aid, not evidence of an article's contents. The
following chapters were read from the repository PDFs (Gems 3 is scanned;
its pp. 109-116 were rendered and OCR-transcribed).

| Article from `references/game-dev-gems-toc.md` | Useful finding | Change adopted | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gero Gerber, *A Flexible User Interface Layout System for Divergent Environments*, Game Programming Gems 8, 4.10, pp. 442-452 ([index](../../references/game-dev-gems-toc.md#L7410)) | Layout variants, safe regions and shared defaults avoid copied screens. Runtime-changing conditions cannot safely use initialization-only caches. | Viewport is an explicit safe-area rectangle; uniform DPI conversion belongs to the adapter. Fractional lengths and anchors coexist with logical fixed sizes. Future theme variants have explicit viewport/locale/input revisions. | Do not copy its XML condition-class hierarchy, arbitrary expression language, platform names, resolution exclusions or stretched virtual screen. U0 has no theme/variant parser. |
| Greg Seegert, *Real-Time Input and UI in 3D Games*, Game Programming Gems 3, 1.13, pp. 109-116 ([index](../../references/game-dev-gems-toc.md#L6886)) | Buffered events preserve brief transitions; authoring data and localization need separation; character input is different from raw gameplay key input. | Ordered event routing with immediate action results, explicit capture/consumption, stable action IDs independent of labels. Future text composition uses platform text events and Text shaping, never key-to-character synthesis. | DirectX8, Windows character APIs and wide strings are historical examples, not portable APIs to adopt. Network prediction is outside this UI change. |
| Hyunwoo Ki, *Optimizing a 3D UI Engine for Mobile Devices*, GPU Pro 1, VI.4, pp. 397-411 ([index](../../references/game-dev-gems-toc.md#L9051)) | Clip invisible work, reduce state changes, batch text, and selectively cache costly composites. | U0 emits only visible clipped rectangles in paint order. Future renderer batches adjacent compatible commands, retains atlas resources, and measures overdraw/cache costs. | Do not reorder translucent commands globally for texture batching. Do not adopt its device timings, 16-bit texture defaults, nearest filtering, manual resource GC or whole-panel caching as universal optimizations. |

The resulting architecture adds safe-area/scale revision ownership, a common
clip contract for rendering and hit testing, release consumption after a widget
is removed, and explicit text/IME milestones. These are engineering adaptations
of the articles, not their original implementations.

Ui does not link Platform, Input, Text, RHI, Qt or any third-party UI framework.
Input adapters translate platform records to ordered `Event` values. They route
UI before gameplay and honor `Consumed`; pointer IDs must remain stable for a
gesture. Multiple surfaces use different contexts. UI resolution and event
routing are main-thread operations. Rendering may copy committed commands into
its own frame storage; it cannot retain borrowed spans across document commits.

The game owns domain state and localized text/semantic names. Ui owns geometry,
paint order, focus and a single captured pointer. The first slice exposes button
roles/IDs/geometry, not a full accessibility tree. A DOM adapter should use real
buttons and native keyboard/assistive semantics rather than reimplement them.
A future native accessibility bridge must include names, values, states and
notifications, not infer semantics from color. [W3C modal guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/)
supports scoped focus and restoration for U2; U0 does not implement modals.

## U0 document and lifecycle contract

`TryInitialize(capacity)` allocates two bounded buffers and an ID table once.
Capacity must be 1..65536; allocation failure returns `OutOfMemory`. It cannot
be resized in play. Destroy and recreate a context explicitly to change capacity.
No allocation occurs in document resolution, painting, focus or event routing.

`TrySetDocument(elements, viewport)` copies plain values into staging, checks
IDs, parents, finite geometry, enum ranges and RGBA channels, and resolves each
element once. Successful resolution publishes the complete staging buffer;
failure leaves the previous document, paint and interaction state intact. An
empty document is valid and clears obsolete focus. Input capture ownership stays
until release/cancel even when its target disappears, so a UI gesture cannot
release into gameplay. Identity is a nonzero application-owned 64-bit key;
reusing an ID for a different logical control during an active gesture is a
caller error. Labels, array addresses and submission indices are unsuitable IDs.

Parents are earlier indices in the submitted span. Submission order is paint
order and focus order; the caller emits the desired order explicitly. This
precludes cycles without traversal stacks, recursion or virtual dispatch. There
is no z-index sorter. Children inherit authored visibility and enabled state.
A hidden child consumes no flow space. Disabled controls paint but never focus
or activate. Disabled buttons still consume pointer gestures over their surface.
Decorations are pointer-transparent unless `BlockPointer` is set.

Layout uses logical pixels, top-left origin and +Y down. Fraction lengths use
the parent's content extent, after padding. Row/column flow overrides the child's
alignment on the flow axis; cross-axis alignment and explicit offsets still
apply. Flow does not auto-shrink or wrap. Overflow is clipped by default; explicit
`ClipChildren=false` permits overflow inside the ancestor clip. Viewport clipping
always applies. Hit testing uses half-open rectangles and the same clip as paint,
in reverse paint order. Zero-area boxes cannot focus. Extents/padding/gaps must
be finite and nonnegative; offsets may be negative. Malformed and overflowing
geometry are rejected, not silently converted into huge GPU coordinates.

The adapter converts framebuffer positions to logical coordinates with one
uniform scale and removes platform safe-area insets before resolution. It must
re-resolve before routing events following a viewport/DPI change. U0 does not
read DPI, rotate, infer device breakpoints or store stale viewport caches.

A button captures on down and activates on release inside its current clipped
rectangle; release outside cancels activation. Unrelated pointer releases cannot
activate it. Cancel/focus loss terminates capture. `FocusNext/Previous` wrap in
submission order, skipping hidden/disabled/fully clipped elements; `Activate`
returns the focused button's ID. Platform repeat policy is the adapter's concern.
Applications apply returned actions after `Route`, preventing reentrant mutation.
U0 omits pointer movement/hover, multipointer gestures and keyboard press/release
capture. Those extensions must preserve gesture ownership, including cancellation.

Paint output is a sequence of clipped solid rectangles with straight alpha and
linear RGB. The renderer handles alpha composition and attachment encoding.
There are no resource handles or borrowed strings in the U0 document. Theme
selection is ordinary application data. A future renderer adds explicit typed
image/glyph resources and scissor commands without changing identity or input.

## Maintainability, debugging and optimization

A single implementation file owns validation, resolution and input state. The
public header uses Base and span only. Inspect `GetLayout()` to find the exact
ID, bounds, clip, enabled/visible state; inspect `GetPaintCommands()` to reproduce
paint order; inspect `InputResult` for ownership and action. `GetStats()` exposes
submitted elements, painted elements and layout visits. Add a debug view as a
consumer of this data, not a second layout/input system. Stable IDs connect a
future authored source location to screenshots and event recordings.

Normal resolution is O(capacity + elements), with open-addressed ID checking;
adversarial collisions can make validation O(elements squared). Capacity is
bounded and documents are trusted application values. Input hit testing/focus
lookup is linear in elements, which is appropriate for HUDs. A spatial index,
virtualized list or cached subtree requires an actual measured large-screen
consumer. U0 intentionally resolves full documents; there is no dirty graph or
hash-based change detection whose invalidation must be debugged.

GPU layout state never feeds back into layout. Preserve translucent order;
merge only adjacent compatible paint commands. Cache shaped runs by font face
revision, locale, bidi direction, text and wrap width. Cache layout only with
explicit dependency revisions. Prefer virtualization to clipping thousands of
live list items. Render-target caching requires measured benefit after accounting
for memory, invalidations and overdraw. Do not sample these counters inside a
text-shaping callback or use synchronous GPU queries on the UI path.

The Sandbox's six-command fullscreen uniform adapter is deliberately bounded.
It proves U0 on the current renderer, but per-fragment rectangle loops scale with
screen area and are not the eventual general UI renderer. U1 replaces this
adapter with indexed quads/scissors once the RHI supports them.

## Delivery sequence and acceptance

| Milestone | Deliverable | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U0 (this change) | CPU document layout, clipped rect paint, button routing/focus, SDK export, shared Sandbox HUD | Debug/Development and ASan/UBSan tests; format/tidy; installed native/web consumer; transactional failure/capture regressions; actual browser pixels |
| U1 | RHI quad/index/texture/scissor capabilities; UiRender and UiText adapters, atlas uploads | Vulkan/WebGPU/WebGL 2 pixel parity; shaping fixtures, atlas exhaustion/device loss; no GPU work in Ui; batching/overdraw measurements |
| U2 | Semantic names/values, native accessibility, text edit/IME, modal scopes, controller direction navigation, scrolling | Screen reader/keyboard/controller journeys; composition/bidi/grapheme tests; focus restore and cancellation under removal/reload |
| U3 | Versioned authoring documents, shared themes/variants, localization, atomic hot reload, inspector | Bounds/ID/source diagnostics; rejected reload preserves live UI; portrait/ultrawide/DPI/safe-area/text-expansion matrix; no user-code callbacks in validation |
| U4 | Virtualized lists, explicit dirty revisions, selective cache/animation | Representative large-menu captures; frame cost p50/p95 and memory before/after; invalidation regressions; reduced-motion support |

Do not claim a universal performance target before defining representative
screens and hardware. Record CPU resolution/input/paint time, allocation count,
capacity/high-water, quads/batches, atlas misses/uploads and overdraw separately.
The initial correctness suite exercises failure rollback, flow/clip consistency,
reorder identity, disabled/hidden ancestors, pointer ownership and focus loss.
Validation results and unfulfilled gates belong in `ui-validation.md`.
