# Ludus Editor workspace (E0) — implementation evidence ledger

This ledger records the **actual** state of the E0 implementation: what was
implemented, which gates ran and passed, and which gates are **blocked by the
build environment** and therefore remain incomplete. Per `tasks.md`, no
completion box is checked without attached evidence, and offscreen/unit success
never substitutes for interactive Wayland or installed-SDK acceptance.

## Starting revision

- Branch: `main`, baseline commit `3ac97af` ("docs(editor): specify first
  workspace milestone and Kiro handoff"). Working tree was clean at start
  (`git status --porcelain` empty).
- First implementation batch committed on branch `editor-workspace-e0` as
  `df4bf56`.

## Update log

**Session 2 (continuation).** The build environment is unchanged (still no
Clang 18, no Qt 6, no display, no managed CMake/venv — re-verified), so the
C++/Qt/native gates remain BLOCKED. Work this session closed real gaps in the
runnable Python layer (E0.2/E0.3 acceptance), with evidence:

- **Implemented the mandated cooperative per-build-tree lock** (E0.2 /
  design §7), which was missing: `editor_tool.BuildTreeLock` takes a nonblocking
  `flock` on `<build_dir>/.cmake/.ludus-editor.lock` held for the whole
  operation (including runtime ownership); a second instance gets a `Busy`
  result. Covered by `test_second_instance_on_same_build_tree_is_busy`.
- **Fixed a real pipe-deadlock bug** in the supervisor loop: completion was
  gated on *both* child pipes reaching EOF, so an exiting leader whose
  descendant kept the inherited stdout pipe open hung the operation. Completion
  is now driven by the **leader's** non-reaping exit observation; a surviving
  descendant is then cleaned up by `finalize_normal` with deadlines. Covered by
  `test_exiting_leader_with_surviving_writer_is_cleaned_up` (regression-guarded
  by the exact-argv and nonzero-exit tests, which still pass).
- **Added nine real-process acceptance tests** enumerated by the E0.3 gate but
  previously untested (TERM-ignoring child → KILL escalation, surviving writer,
  simultaneous stdout/stderr, failed executable spawn, repeated Stop, build
  success racing Stop, duplicate/stale credit idempotence, unrelated process
  never signaled, Busy on a locked tree).
- **Broadened the acceptance interpreter matrix**: the editor + RAD suites pass
  under the project-minimum Python 3.10.20 and 3.12.13, not only system 3.9.

No specification file was rewritten; no standard was weakened; no dependency was
auto-installed; nothing was pushed.

## Build environment reality (material deviation from the design baseline)

`scripts/python/engine.py doctor` on this host reports:

| Tool | Required | Found | Satisfies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python | ≥ 3.10.0 | 3.9.25 (system) | no (pyenv has 3.10–3.14 available) |
| Clang | ≥ 18.0.0 | 15.0.7 | **no** |
| LLD | ≥ 18.0.0 | 15.0.7 | **no** |
| clang-tidy | ≥ 18.0.0 | reports non-18 | **no** |
| Project-managed CMake/Ninja/Conan | pinned | missing | **no** |
| Project-managed venv | present | missing | **no** |

Additional facts:

- **Qt 6 is not installed** and the host is Amazon Linux 2023 (`dnf`, fedora-like),
  not the Ubuntu/apt host the design assumed (which listed Qt base 6.4.2 as an
  apt candidate). `find_package(Qt6 6.4 ...)` cannot succeed here.
- **No Wayland/X display** (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `DISPLAY` are empty); this is a
  headless sandbox. Native GUI/runtime acceptance is impossible here.
- `init.sh` / bootstrap cannot complete: it needs network Conan plus pinned
  Clang 18 and the managed venv, none of which are available.

**Consequence.** The C++/CMake/Qt build gates (E0.0 build proof) and the native
Wayland GUI + runtime acceptance (E0.5) **cannot be executed in this
environment** and are recorded below as BLOCKED, not passed. The Python tooling
layer (adapter, protocol, process ownership, File API extraction) and all shared
descriptor fixtures **are** fully implemented and verified here, because they run
on the available Python interpreter. This matches the spec's instruction to
"report an unavailable environment rather than declaring the spike complete."

## What was implemented

| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| CMake option + gating | `CMakeLists.txt` (`LUDUS_BUILD_EDITOR` OFF, native-only `add_subdirectory`), `apps/editor/CMakeLists.txt` (local Qt discovery, host gating, AUTOMOC per target, `QT_NO_KEYWORDS`, test-exceptions only on tests, no install/export) |
| State + model (C++) | `apps/editor/src/internal/{project_descriptor,workspace,project_store,log_buffer,tool_process,controller,main_window}.h`, `apps/editor/src/{workspace,project_store,log_buffer,tool_process,controller,main_window}.cpp`, `apps/editor/main.cpp` |
| Offscreen C++ tests | `apps/editor/tests/{workspace,project_store,log_buffer,tool_process,controller}_tests.cpp` |
| Shared File API logic | `scripts/python/cmake_targets.py` (extracted from RAD; RAD delegates) |
| Descriptor validation | `scripts/python/editor_project.py` (shares fixtures with C++) |
| Tooling adapter | `scripts/python/editor_tool.py` (stdio protocol, selectors supervisor, owned process groups, non-reaping cleanup, bounded output/credit) |
| Adapter tests | `scripts/python/test_editor_tool.py` (descriptor + File API + real-process/protocol) |
| Launcher | `scripts/editor`, `scripts/python/editor_launch.py` |
| Examples | `examples/editor-workspace/ludus.project.json`, `examples/editor-sdk-project/{CMakeLists.txt,CMakePresets.json,ludus.project.json,main.cpp}` |
| Shared fixtures | `apps/editor/tests/fixtures/*.json` + `cases.json` |
| Docs | `docs/development/editor-workspace.md`, this ledger |
| Ignore rule | `.gitignore` adds `.ludus/` |

## Gates — actual results on this host

Commands were run from the repository root unless noted.

### PASS

- **Python tooling test suite** (system Python 3.9.25):
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/python -p 'test_*.py'`
  → `Ran 75 tests ... OK (skipped=13)`. The 13 skips are the pre-existing
  `test_web_package` tests that require Node; they are unrelated to the editor.
  The pre-editor baseline was 40 tests; the editor adds 35 (`test_editor_tool`)
  and the RAD suite remains 22, with **no regressions**.
- **RAD behavior preserved after File API extraction**:
  `python3 -m unittest test_rad_debugger` → `Ran 22 tests ... OK`. RAD now
  delegates its codemodel query/resolution to `cmake_targets.py` while keeping
  its historical client name, error strings and laxer behavior.
- **Shared descriptor fixtures** validate identically to the recorded verdicts:
  `test_editor_tool.DescriptorFixtureTests` (5 tests) — valid Ludus/cmake
  descriptors (including empty/quoted/Unicode/shell-looking args), and rejected
  bad-version/unknown-field/absolute-path/bad-target/invalid-UTF-8/NUL cases.
- **Shared File API logic** (`FileApiTests`, 7 tests): executable-only listing,
  custom artifact paths, library/ambiguous/missing rejection, wrong codemodel
  version, multi-config rejection, source/build identity mismatch, reference
  traversal rejection, oversized-file bound.
- **Real-process / protocol behavior** (`RealProcessTests`, 22 tests, real OS
  pipes and real child processes — not mocked Popen):
  - configure discovers targets and succeeds; digest mismatch → `Conflict`;
    a malformed/wrong-version File API reply → `ReplyInvalid`;
  - build_run preserves the **exact** argument list and cwd (empty, `a b`,
    `日本語`, `$(echo hi)`, `"quoted"`, `--flag`) observed through a real child;
  - a failed build launches **no** runtime even with a stale successful binary
    present (`BuildFailed`, no `runtime_started`);
  - cancel cleans up an **ordinary grandchild** (verified the grandchild PID is
    dead after cancel), `cleanup_confirmed=true`, exit 130;
  - a **SIGTERM-ignoring** runtime is escalated to SIGKILL within the deadline
    and cleanup is still confirmed (PID dead afterward);
  - an **exiting leader with a surviving writer** (grandchild holding the
    inherited stdout pipe) completes only after the descendant is cleaned up —
    this test also drove a real bug fix (see below);
  - **simultaneous stdout and stderr** are both delivered;
  - a **failed executable spawn** (non-executable artifact) reports
    `ArtifactInvalid`/`SpawnFailed` and never starts a runtime;
  - **repeated Stop** is idempotent (exactly one terminal result);
  - a **build success racing Stop** does not launch (stop latched during a slow
    configure prevents the later spawn);
  - cancel accepted before spawn prevents the launch;
  - stdin EOF (parent loss) cancels;
  - **duplicate/stale credit** acknowledgements are idempotent (not errors);
  - an **unrelated process** started outside the owned group is never signaled
    by cleanup (it runs to completion);
  - a **second editor instance** holding the per-build-tree lock forces `Busy`;
  - nonzero runtime exit → `RuntimeFailed` with the exit code; a runtime signal
    → `RuntimeSignaled` with the signal number;
  - no-newline (300 KiB) output stays bounded per frame; invalid UTF-8 output is
    replaced; a protocol version mismatch and a future/non-boundary credit
    offset are `ProtocolError` (exit 2).
  The suite also runs clean under `-W error::ResourceWarning` (no fd/process
  leaks).
- **Python compile** of all `scripts/python/*.py` (`py_compile`) and the full
  editor + RAD suite pass under the managed-equivalent **Python 3.10.20** (the
  project minimum) and **3.12.13** (`57 tests ... OK` each), not only system 3.9.

### BLOCKED (environment-limited; remain incomplete)

These require the reference toolchain / Qt / a Wayland desktop, none of which
exist on this host. They are **not** claimed as passing.

| Gate | Why blocked |
| --- | --- |
| E0.0 Qt dependency spike: minimal window under Clang 18, warnings-as-errors, `-fno-exceptions` | No Clang 18 and no Qt 6; `find_package(Qt6 6.4)` cannot resolve. |
| `./scripts/build linux-clang-debug` / `-development` (Editor ON and a separate Editor-OFF tree) | No managed CMake/Ninja/Conan, no Clang 18, bootstrap cannot complete. |
| `./scripts/test linux-clang-debug` / `-development` (incl. `ludus_editor_tests`, offscreen) | Depends on a successful Editor-ON build. |
| `./scripts/check --all` (clang-format/clang-tidy 18) on the new C++ | Pinned clang-format/clang-tidy 18 unavailable (host has non-18). |
| `./scripts/build/test linux-clang-asan-ubsan` | Same toolchain/bootstrap blockers. |
| `./scripts/check-build-budget` | Needs a configured build. |
| `./scripts/install-sdk` + external `editor-sdk-project` consumer | Needs a full build + install; also confirms no Qt/Editor leak in the SDK. |
| Native Wayland GUI + separate-process runtime acceptance (all 10 demo steps) | Headless sandbox, no compositor/GPU. Offscreen tests do not substitute. |
| Noisy-output RSS / UI heartbeat latency measurement (E0.5 targets) | Needs the built GUI running natively. |

## Design conformance notes and deliberate choices

- **No-exceptions**: all C++ app/engine code is exception-free and compiled with
  the inherited `-fno-exceptions` via `ludus_apply_project_defaults`;
  `ludus_enable_test_exceptions` is applied **only** to `ludus_editor_tests`.
  Errors are returned as status enums / result structs / `std::optional`.
- **Optional/isolated**: Qt is discovered only inside `apps/editor` and only when
  `LUDUS_BUILD_EDITOR=ON`; there is no `install()`/export of any editor target or
  header, no Qt in Conan/init/SDK, and the browser build path is untouched.
- **Shared, not duplicated, File API logic**: `cmake_targets.py` is the single
  implementation; RAD delegates to it with `require_version=False`/`bounded=
  False` and its own messages so RAD's 22 tests pass unchanged.
- **One asynchronous Python tooling operation**: `editor_tool.py` is a
  one-operation `--stdio` process using a selectors loop, `start_new_session`
  process groups, `waitid(WNOWAIT)` non-reaping observation, TERM→KILL deadlines,
  and `/proc`-based descendant inspection — no worker threads, no
  `communicate()` full buffers, no `startDetached`, no shell concatenation.
  Completion is driven by the leader's exit (not stream EOF), so a surviving
  descendant holding an inherited pipe cannot deadlock the operation.
- **Cooperative per-build-tree exclusion**: a nonblocking `flock` on
  `<build_dir>/.cmake/.ludus-editor.lock` is held for the whole operation; a
  concurrent instance on the same tree gets `Busy`. It is cooperative by design
  (external CLI builds do not honor it; documented as unsupported).
- **Bounded protocol**: fixed 256 KiB output-credit window, 1 MiB aggregate
  control cap with a 4 KiB terminal-result reserve, 256 KiB line cap, 2 MiB
  framing backlog cap, 1 MiB retained log with visible truncation markers.
- **Codemodel-driven artifacts**: the executable is always resolved from the
  CMake File API codemodel (named client `client-ludus-editor`), with
  source/build identity checks and a post-build re-resolution; the artifact path
  is never guessed and a failed/cancelled build never launches an old binary.

## Requirement → evidence map (current state)

## Task status

Because the native/C++ gates cannot run here, no E0 task box is marked complete
in `tasks.md`. The Python-side acceptance (E0.2/E0.3 behavior, shared fixtures,
RAD preservation) is demonstrably passing; the C++/Qt/native portions are
implemented and awaiting a reference-toolchain host to execute their gates.

## How to finish acceptance on a reference host

1. `./init.sh` (pinned Clang 18 / LLD / managed CMake/Ninja/Conan / venv);
   install Qt 6 (`qt6-base-dev qt6-wayland` or distro equivalent).
2. `cmake --preset linux-clang-development -DLUDUS_BUILD_EDITOR=ON` then
   `cmake --build --preset linux-clang-development --target ludus_editor`.
3. `ctest` the `editor` label with `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` for the C++ unit
   tests; run `./scripts/check linux-clang-development --all`,
   `./scripts/build/test linux-clang-asan-ubsan`, `./scripts/check-build-budget`.
4. Configure a **separate** Editor-OFF binary dir and `./scripts/install-sdk`;
   confirm no Qt/Editor target or header appears in the install.
5. On a real Wayland desktop with a usable GPU, run `./scripts/editor` and
   complete the ten demonstration steps in `requirements.md`; record the
   session, versions and observed results, and the noisy-output RSS / UI latency
   measurements.

## Native macOS port

The macOS source-checkout Editor enables Qt Cocoa on arm64/x64, host-native
setup/launch presets, and shared version-2 SDK project operations. The explicit
`[.macos-journey]` fixture records real Cocoa creation, build/run/Stop, read-only
missing-setup diagnosis and repeated repair; ordinary offscreen tests remain a
separate check. Darwin process regressions exercise non-reaping exit observation,
descendant cleanup, cancellation, bounded output and uncertain ownership.
See [current usage and limitations](editor-workspace.md#macos-validation).
Live generation publication and RAD debugging remain guarded on macOS.
Game release packaging is covered by the later
[macOS release acceptance](game-packaging-publishing-evidence.md#macos-release-packaging). Native acceptance targets Apple silicon; Intel is not claimed.

Local Apple silicon acceptance: Qt 6.11.2 Cocoa, pinned Clang 18.1.8,
macOS 26.6 and deployment baseline 14.0. The Cocoa journey passed all 37
assertions, including real game launch/Stop and repeated project setup repair.
The complete offscreen Editor CTest passed; 68 Python setup/adapter/ownership
checks passed (four opt-in GUI cases skipped in that noninteractive invocation).

## Project/SDK lifecycle orientation (2026-10-11)

Implemented on `codex/project-lifecycle-ux`, isolated from the primary checkout,
starting from freshly fetched `origin/main` at `f9cc7c8`. The task/use-case matrix
and delivery boundary are in [the workspace guide](editor-workspace.md#project-lifecycle-tasks-and-audiences).
Experience and discipline are independent; the proposed journeys include
beginners, other-engine users, professionals, engine engineers, researchers,
content contributors and QA. These are design scenarios, not interview evidence.

The Project tab now exposes setup/selected SDK identity, lifecycle actions,
friendly profile labels with exact preset data, explicit descriptor save, and
expandable build/launch details. Existing controller guards, cancellation,
read-only open/check and separate document save ownership remain authoritative.
SDK identity uses a bounded private control report instead of truncated terminal
text or droppable ordinary output. Native acceptance found and fixed a macOS
setup bug: CMake canonicalizes the managed sysroot symlink; generated presets
must use the same resolved path while signatures still detect link retargeting.

Validation host: macOS 26.6, Apple Silicon, Clang/LLVM 18.1.8, CMake 3.29.6,
Ninja 1.11.1.3, Qt 6.11.2/Cocoa. Installed SDK input was Ludus 0.1.0 Development,
`arm64-apple-darwin`, revision `be22bf31afd9bceefaec2aa6a9d84a2fc8e3ccce`.
Tools and SDK inputs were shared read-only; build trees and outputs were isolated.

- The complete configured native Development build (including editor/tests)
  passes with warnings-as-errors.
- Complete Development and clean Debug/UBSan offscreen suites: each 113 passed,
  six explicitly skipped, 1,561 assertions passed. UBSan ran with
  `halt_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1`. Python setup/creation/project/adapter suites:
  112 passed.
- Native Cocoa overview/profile tests pass (59 assertions); small-window
  reachability passes (32 assertions). Screenshots at 800×640 and normal workspace
  sizes were visually inspected for wrapping, scrolling and accessible controls.
- The real Cocoa SDK journey creates, configures/builds/tests, opens, runs, stops
  an owned long-running game, reopens with missing local presets without repair,
  then repairs twice (42 assertions passed). Successful reports include complete
  installation identity.
- Browser file-bridge Node tests pass (2). No Qt-Wasm UI build or browser parity
  qualification was performed for this slice.
- Repository formatting and foundational include checks pass. Changed C++
  sources pass Clang-tidy 18; documentation
  inventory, strict MkDocs, generated API and documentation-only wiki checks pass.

The `scripts/check --all` wrapper stops at the isolated checkout's absent local
Conan bootstrap marker/toolchain. Gate components use the existing isolated
compilation database with explicit shared read-only dependency inputs; no
bootstrap repair writes to the primary checkout. Full static analysis covered 315 configured translation units. After preparing
and successfully rechecking 32 initially missing module-map inputs, 311 C++
units pass, including all changed sources. Four unchanged Objective-C++ units
(Metal/Cocoa implementation and tests) remain blocked: Clang-tidy 18 cannot
parse Apple SDK libc++ builtins including `__is_nothrow_convertible`,
`__builtin_clzg` and `__builtin_ctzg`. The local whole-tree gate is not clean.

The combined ASan/UBSan editor builds, but its Clang 18 ASan runtime deadlocks
before `main` on this host. A sampled stack shows initialization re-entering
`AsanInitInternal` through dyld shared-cache iteration, `_Block_copy`, and malloc,
then waiting in `StaticSpinMutex::LockSlow`. The process was terminated; this is
an unavailable runtime gate, **not** a clean ASan result. A clean Debug/UBSan rebuild and full run pass. An intermediate incremental
build retained an old controller layout in one object; the clean rebuild
resolved its Qt assertion. Linux reference-toolchain ASan/UBSan CI remains
required before marking the change ready. Full native-platform suites and
moderated sessions with representative programming/content disciplines remain
separate acceptance work.

## Gameplay World workspace: first declarative component-authoring slice

This slice adds a World document owner beside the existing sample Scene adapter.
The canonical workflow, schema contract, audience scenarios and scope limits are
in [Gameplay world authoring](editor-workspace.md#gameplay-world-authoring).
The editable `live-edit-game/authoring` starter is embedded in the sample library;
it is not bound to that game's runtime.

Evidence collected on macOS arm64 using Clang/LLVM 18.1.8, managed CMake 3.29.6,
Ninja 1.11.1.3 and Qt 6.11.2, in an isolated task worktree:

- Native editor/application tests build warning-clean with warnings-as-errors.
- World regressions: 13 cases and 432 assertions pass. They cover strict bounded
  schema/document loading, stable identity, required/optional/tag components,
  self-reference duplication, referenced deletion, typed conversion, asset kinds,
  invalid text preservation, file/schema/lock conflicts, symlinks, new-file
  creation, explicit damaged/stale recovery refusal, recovery-write failure reporting, long reference labels, menu ownership and cancelled
  Close Project.
- Complete Development and clean Debug/UBSan editor suites: each 126 passed,
  six explicitly skipped and 1,992 assertions passed. UBSan uses
  `halt_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1`. Native filesystem-watch cases run with
  host access; no game/runtime rendering is inferred from offscreen results.
- Existing scene-document Debug/UBSan regressions: four cases, 138 assertions pass.
- Clang-tidy 18 passes for the new model/workspace/tests and changed MainWindow,
  layout and document-command units. Project formatter covers the changed C++.
- Styled 800×640 World screenshot inspected: entity list and persistent commands
  remain available; long component help and full-height fields scroll in the
  inspector. Regressions check that fields are not compressed below their minimum
  size. This is offscreen layout evidence, not native pointer/IME/screen-reader
  acceptance.
- Review found and fixed replacement-before-discard validation, re-reading a
  same-file reopen after Save, in-place entity/reference-label refresh, removal
  of matching recovery when Undo reaches the saved baseline, and compressed
  inspector rows, bounded reference-picker sizing and persistent recovery-write
  failure feedback. The associated failure/identity/layout paths have regressions.
- Canonical documentation index/link checks, strict MkDocs, API inventory
  generation (133 public headers, no new documentation gaps) and documentation
  wiki parity checks pass.

The previously recorded Clang 18 ASan startup deadlock on this macOS host remains
an unavailable gate; the UBSan result does not establish a clean ASan result.
Reference Linux ASan/UBSan and browser compilation qualification remain pending.
World browser file actions explain and enforce the native-editor limitation.
Runtime binding, production-scale worlds, hierarchy/prefabs and schema migrations
are explicit remaining capabilities. Audience scenarios are designed acceptance
cases, not interviews or a user study.
